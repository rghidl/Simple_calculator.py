# Simple Calculator 🧮

This is a simple Python project I made to practice basic programming.  
The program is a calculator that runs in the terminal.  
The user picks an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide), then enters two numbers, and gets the result.

## Features:

- Checks if the user enters something that's not a number.
- Shows a message if someone tries to divide by zero.
- Tells the user if they pick a wrong option.
- Very beginner-friendly 🌟

## How to use it:

1. Run the file `calculator.py`
2. You will see a menu asking you to pick a function:
   - 1: multiply
   - 2: divide
   - 3: add
   - 4: subtract
3. Then enter the two numbers
4. You’ll see the result, or a message if there’s a mistake

## Why I made it:

I wanted to practice:
- If/else statements
- Try/except for error handling
- How to deal with user input

## Language used:

- Python 3 🐍
